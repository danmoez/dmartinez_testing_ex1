# dmartinez_testing_ex1
This Repo is meant to cover Excersice for the testing test. Technologies used:

CodeceptJS - SuperCharged End 2 End Testing JS Framework
Selenium WebDriver
BDD

The reasoning behind choosing of this Stack is that I read about it sometime ago but never had the chance to implement a POC. The implemented Design Pattern was Page Object Model (POM) as my intention is to leave a maintainable and escalable FW for future reference. I also used Gherkin to create a more accesible FW across the organization.  Note: As the intended example is working with localhost this POC can't be tested.
